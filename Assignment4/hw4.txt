While unsatisfiable with 3 colors, graph1.txt can be satisfied with 4 colors.
This means that it is necessary to have at least 4 colors to make the problem
solvable (any more than 4 will only make it easier since there are more
color options for each node)

The given RSat solution requires that these nodes hold the same color:

Nodes 1, 3
Nodes 2, 4
Nodes 5, 7
Node  6

Given this, a possible solution is to assign red, blue, green, yellow
to these groups of colors respectively.

The number of nodes in graph2.txt is much larger than graph1.txt, so I 
expected the minimum number of colors to be greater. Starting at the 
arbitrarily high number 14, I found that it was satisfiable. Thus, 
I kept going down to restrict the number of colors and found that it was 
unsatisfiable at 7 colors. Therefore the minimun numberf of colors for 
graph2.txt is 8 colors.
